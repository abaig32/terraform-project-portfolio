Welcome to a GitHub Repository that showcases the several terraform projects that I have worked on as my overall understanding of the language
has improved. This portfolio will start from basic level architectures and keep growing as my skills improve. I mainly focus on using AWS as the 
cloud service provider for my projects, however, I will start to incorporate more Azure into my projects as time goes on. Please take the time to 
look through these projects and join me on my journey to improve!
